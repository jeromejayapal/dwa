		<h1>Jerome Jayapal</h1>
		<p>Hello! My name is Jerome Jayapal. I work at Verizon Communications
		as a Desktop Engineer. I recently graduated but I love learning
		and wanted to take the chance to learn an aspect of web development that I know
		very little about...but that is all about to change with this class.</p>
		<p>I decided to go with asmallorange as my web host and I am using their small sharing plan</p>
		<p>I started off using Dreamweaver as my code editor but after all of the negative press from 
		Professor Susan Buck I decided to switch to Notepad++ :)</p>
		<p>My git repository is http://github.com/jeromejayapal/dwa</p>
