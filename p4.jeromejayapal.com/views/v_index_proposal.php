		<h1>Project 4 Proposal - Jerome Jayapal</h1>
		<br />
		<p>CSCI E-75</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<br />
		<p>My proposal for project 4 is to do a personal blog. The title of this project
		will simply be Jerome Jayapal Blog or just Jerome Jayapal website. The website will 
		only consist of a few webpages that are available for the end user: 
		home page, about me, and a contact page. I will be building the blog portion
		of the website utilizing a database very similar to p2 with slight modifications and additions.</p>
		<br />
		<h2 style="color:red">Details for Professor Susan Buck</h2>
		<br />
		<p style="color:red">Admin account:
		<br />
		<strong>jerome@gmail.com
		<br />
		admin</strong>
		<br /><br />
		To test blog posts: You can login at p4.jeromejayapal.com/users/login with admin account information above.
		For security reasons I have not created a link to this page anywhere.<br/><br />
		
		Technically, you are able to create your own profile at p4.jeromejayapal.com/users/signup but their posts do not
		show up on the homepage but instead on the p4.jeromejayapal.com/posts/index. You can logout at p4.jeromejayapal.com/users/logout.
		These options are left in because I may decided to incorporate some sort of community within the website in the future.
