		<h1>Jerome Jayapal</h1>
		<p>Hello! My name is Jerome Jayapal. Here's a little bit about me.
		I recently graduated from Davenport University in Grand Rapids and 
		moved to Boston for work. I work at Verizon Communications
		as a Systems Engineer.</p>
		<p>This website is part of a project for CSCI E-75 with Professor
		Susan Buck and you may find parts of this website under construction.
		Don't worry though I'm working on making it better. Thanks for visiting!</p>
