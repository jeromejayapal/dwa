		<h1>Project 4 Proposal - Jerome Jayapal</h1>
		<p>CSCI E-75</p>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>My proposal for project 4 is to do a personal blog. The title of this project
		will simply be Jerome Jayapal Blog or just Jerome Jayapal website. I've been wanting to work on
		a personal website for a while and think that this a great opportunity to finally work on it.
		Navigating through the website will include JavaScript. There might also be a contact page that 
		would be done using JavaScript. Photography is a hobby of mine and I'm hoping to incorporate 
		it into the website through the use of a database. </p>
		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>One of my favorite photography blogs: <a href="http://scottkelby.com/">http://scottkelby.com/</a>
		<br /><br />
		A friend's website that incorporates JavaScript into the naviagation: <a href="http://www.nicholasgebben.com/">http://www.nicholasgebben.com/</a>
		<br /><br />
		A friend's photography website: <a href="http://marklightphotography.com/#/gallery/boston-massachusetts/dsc-1163/">http://marklightphotography.com/#/gallery/boston-massachusetts/dsc-1163/</a></p>
