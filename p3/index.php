		<h1>Project 3 Proposal - Jerome Jayapal</h1>
		<p>CSCI E-75</p>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Right now I am looking at creating a deals website for project 4. My proposal for project 3 is to create a
		side bar navigation that allows you to filter by categories. The best example of this
		would be Pandora but also similar to Google's search. My other proposal if I have time and am able
		to do it would be to create a quick view option for deals that you see on many shopping sites. This would allow
		you to stay on the same page but still find more details about a certain product.</p>
		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>www.google.com
		</br>
		www.pandora.com
		</br>
		www.slickdeals.net</p>
